## Troubleshooting

### "Submission URL not configured" message

**Problem:** Students see this after submitting
**Fix:** You forgot to add the Web App URL to `DoNow_Activity.html` (see Step 4)

### "Failed to submit to Google Sheets" error

**Problem:** The script can't write to the sheet
**Possible causes:**
1. Wrong URL in the HTML file
2. Apps Script not deployed as "Anyone" can access
3. Sheet permissions issue

**Fix:**
1. Check the URL is correct
2. Redeploy the Apps Script with "Anyone" access
3. Make sure the script has permission to write to your sheet

### Duplicate submissions appearing

**Problem:** Student clicked submit multiple times
**Fix:** This is normal! Students can submit multiple revisions. You can delete duplicate rows or just keep the latest timestamp.

### Script permissions expired

**Problem:** Sheet stops receiving submissions after a few months
**Fix:** Go to Apps Script ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Manage deployments ‚Üí Click "Edit" ‚Üí Redeploy

## Privacy & Security Notes

- ‚úÖ **Students don't need Google accounts** - The script accepts submissions from anyone
- ‚úÖ **API key is secure** - Students can't see your API key (it's on Cloudflare)
- ‚úÖ **Sheet is private** - Only you can view the submission sheet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Students can submit as anyone** - They could enter a fake name. Use Google Classroom if this is a concern.

---

## Optional: Add Automatic Grading

You can add formulas in column G (Teacher Notes) to auto-grade:

**Word count check:**
```
=IF(F2>=70, "Met word count ‚úì", "Below minimum ‚úó")
```

**Auto-score:**
```
=IF(F2>=70, 10, IF(F2>=50, 7, 5))
```

## Questions?

2. Test with a simple submission first
3. Check the Apps Script logs (View ‚Üí Logs in Apps Script editor)
